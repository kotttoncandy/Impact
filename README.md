# Impact! The programming language!

This programming language makes life easier when to creating GUI or CLI's.

It is fast and easy to set up.

Also, very easy to use with english-like syntax!

# Setup!

Go to your OS in releases and install the .sh file or the .exe file.

If you have installed the .sh file. Run `source path/to/.sh/file`

If you installed the .exe. Hold onto it.

Afterwards, create a new file names `hello-world.impact`.

In the file, type in `say "Hello World!" ;`

Everything here is essential. So please don't mix around the words or characters.

Last, if your on mac, type in, `impact hello-world.impact`

If your on windows, type in `path/to/exe/ hello-world.impact`

See the wiki on how to create more complex applications!

Happy coding!
